Thanks for purchasing this asset.

Just drag&drop prefab to your scene. When you scale the sun all particle effects will be scaled automatically by script "Sun_scale" on start.
Glow uses mesh particles and has a "lookat" script because billboards are not affected by camera distortions. 
Please use AnimatedTiledTexture script to control sun rotation(rot_speed) and texture animation speed (Frames per Second).

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions: stanislavdol@gmail.com

Good luck with your projects!
